## Welcome to My Website!

Hello there! My name is Raul, and I am currently attending San Francisco State University's M.S. in Business Analytics program. I previously spent a year interning at the Federal Aviation Administration as a Reporting and Analytics Intern where I created various reports and dashboards in Power BI and Excel for a project/program management team. I created this website to showcase some of the projects I have worked on, specifically using Python, SQL, Tableau, and ArcGIS Online.
