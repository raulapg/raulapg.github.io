## Welcome to My Website!

Hello there! My name is Raul, and I am a senior studying Business Administration with a concentration in Information Systems at UC Riverside. I created this website to showcase some of the projects I have worked on, specifically using Python, SQL, Tableau, and ArcGIS Online. Currently, I am trying to land an analytics internship for this upcoming summer before pursuing a Master's in Business Analytics. In my free time I like to watch TV shows and movies (currently watching Jack Ryan on Prime Video), read (currently reading The Hero with a Thousand Faces), and learn languages (currently Portuguese).
