## Welcome to My Website!

Hello there! My name is Raul, and I am currently interning at the Federal Aviation Administration as Project Management Analytics Intern after recently graduating from UC Riverside with a Bachelor's in Business Administration with a concentration in Information Systems. I created this website to showcase some of the projects I have worked on, specifically using Python, SQL, Tableau, and ArcGIS Online.
